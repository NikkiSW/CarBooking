Requirements:

Company car booking scheme.

Users need to access a web page that they will have access to via username and password.
Once given access to the page they will see a calendar (monthly) for the company car.
If they want to book the company car for a day they will be able to see if it is booked and by who. If it is not booked they will be able to book it. In the booking form they will need to provide the time that they will be booking it for and provide a reason. There will be a place to put in the KM recorded.
If the user wants to cancel the booking they can only select a booking that they have made, and they cannot cancel a booking or delete any information that has occurred in the past.
If a booking is made or cancelled an email is sent to the user and the administrator informing them of the event.

PLEASE NOTE THAT NO PHP FRAMEWORK IS TO BE USED




Installation:

•	Unzip the “CarBooking.zip” folder to a location of your choice.
•	Within the “resources” folder there is a file called car_booking.sql. This is the file that contains the MySQL database which needs to be installed.
